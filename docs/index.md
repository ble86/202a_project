# Abstract

Our project is to investigate an embedded systems-based methodology for identifiying a laptop or keyboard user's keystrokes. This project takes a hardware-based approach rather than a software-based approach to replicate a potential malicious attack on a user's computer. Our project is attempting to replicate vibrational-based sensing methods of machine learning identification problems investigated by research groups at Stanford, but to a smaller scale. In our project, vibrational sensors will be placed at the bottom of a laptop and/or keyboard and record vibrational patterns at multiple points of the laptop/keyboard chassis. Following this, a form of supervised or unsupervised learning model will be used to identify the keys that were pressed by the user and transmit those from a microcontroller to another device. The second device will then try to reconstruct the message that is being typed. Our goal is to have our system perform reasonably accurate keystroke identification such that a person separated from the keyboard may be able to deduce the information typed by the keyboard user.
