        <p>
          Our project is to investigate an embedded systems-based methodology for identifiying a laptop or keyboard user's keystrokes.
          This project takes a hardware-based approach rather than a software-based approach to replicate a potential malicious attack on 
          a user's computer. The project here is attemption to replicate vibrational-based sensing methods of Machine Learning identification problems
          investigated by research groups at Stanford, but to a smaller scale. In our project, vibrational sensors will be placed at the bottom of a 
          laptop and/or keyboard and record vibrational patterns at multiple points of the laptop/keyboard chassis. Following this, using some form of
          supervised or unsupervised learning model, we will attempt to identify the keys that were pressed by the user and transmit those from a
          microcontroller to another device to attempt to reconstruct the message that is being typed on a separate device.
          Our goal is to have our system perform reasonably accurate keystroke identification such that a person separated from the keyboard may reconstruct 
          the information typed by the keyboard user.
